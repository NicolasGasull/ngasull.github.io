- Video game music for noobs brainstorming

A lot of music theory isn't useful to those who want to produce video game music as early as possible.
A lot of resources on the net teach you how to make pop music, which isn't the same as video game music at all.

Disclaimer: I'm no good composer and I didn't do music-centric studies. I learned some music as a kid and realized years later it was awesome, which is how I slowly got back into it.
I got hooked into composition as an adult, so I lacked a lot of advanced music theory.

This is actually why I write these articles, for my later self and for people who are in the same situation I was: you know you want to compose stuff, understand how it works, but the resources you find give you a hard time using what you learned in video games.


# Intro

## What is video game music?

The purpose of music is to carry emotions, especially video game music.
It highlights or clarifies the feeling the player should have at any moment of the gameplay.


## How can music carry emotions?

Music that sounds the "nicest", that is the most pleasant to the ear, is probably very boring. Let me explain.
The goal here is not to surprise the listener with crappy music here. Good music has some parts, if you take them in isolation, that may sound very ugly. And it's normal for two reasons. The obvious one is that all the layers of music create something more complete. The most important one is that "ugly" sections create contrast in the music, referred as _tension_.

Most resources on the internet teach music with _tension_ and _resolution_, which are both critical concepts of pop music.
I feel that videogame music doesn't need resolution in the same way as pop music, as a lot of the compositions will be continuous loops that set a dynamic mood.
A strong resolution in a video game would be a victory theme, like mario's end of level music: if you stopped playing it before the last note, the ear would crave that last note because it resolves the tension built up just before it. A strong resolution fits very well a victory theme as it symbolises the end of the trouble (tension = trouble, resolution = ...resolution)

The hardest part of composing is definitely understanding how to carry the emotions we want to carry. Sometime, even with words it's hard to explain an emotion!
I like to think that music is actually the tool that explain emotions where words are failing (any other kind of art too. But music is better, right?! :))


## Where should I start?

If you don't already have them, learn the **very fundamental** of music. Nothing advanced.
Get a small cheap $30 USB keyboard, or larger if you want to be more comfortable.
Learn the notes and associate them with those on your keyboard. As most resources do and many programs rely on them, I will use the international notation in this series of articles (C D E F G A B)
Learn how to read music sheets by associating those notes to each line on the sheet.
Learn how to read music rythm. Most music is "4/4", which means:
1. A _bar_ lasts 4 notes
2. 4 bars create a _phrase_. Musics are divided multiple chained phrases.

Be patient, it will take time to get use to it. Trying to play very simple melodies everyday would help memorizing the notes.
You could write the notes on your keyboard's keys with erasable marker.

If it isn't obvious that this part is important, remember that composing is all about notes: melodies come on top of chord progressions, which are those who will bring emotions to your music.



# The composer's tools

Once you mecanically can read music, you can start by learning how to use any of the tools music composers have on their hands.

## Intervals

## Chords

## Rythm

## Effects

Vibrato, pitch slide, quick note before note, fading in/out/inout, old-school arpeggios, flanger, distorision
