    <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Nicolas Gasull.</p>

    <p>
      I started my carrer building a software development expertise specialized
      in <b>web technologies</b>. I love <b>software architecture</b>,{" "}
      <b>efficiency</b>,<b>programming languages theory</b> and challenges that
      come with developing sofware as a team. I&apos;m also a{" "}
      <b>functional programming</b> enthusiast who always seeks for effective{" "}
      <b>simplicity</b> over fancy complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
      As much as I just defined myself as a developer, I also crave artistic
      creativity. My experience is much lower in this domain and I&apos;m
      spending more time exploring it. I especially enjoy analyzing{" "}
      <b>music composition</b>
      which I intend to express through <b>game dev tools development</b>.
    </p>
