Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicolas Gasull _aka_ blint.

I started my carrer building a software development expertise specialized in **web technologies**. I love **software architecture**, **efficiency**, **programming languages theory** and challenges that come with developing sofware as a team. I'm also a **functional programming** enthusiast who always seeks for effective **simplicity** over fancy complexity.

As much as I just defined myself as a developer, I also crave artistic creativity. My experience is much lower in this domain and I'm spending more time exploring it. I especially enjoy analyzing **music composition** which I intend to express through **game dev tools development**.
