Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicolas Gasull, _aka_ blint or Sonic Gull across art and game development communities.

I started my carrer building a software development expertise specialized in **web technologies**. I love **software architecture** and the challenges that come with it, letting a team stay productive as the code base grows. I'm also a **functional programming** enthusiast who always seeks for effective **simplicity** over fancy complexity.

As much as I just defined myself as a developer, I also crave artistic creativity. My experience is much lower in this domain and I'm spending a lot more time exploring it. So far I enjoy **digital drawing** and **music composition**. Combined with my experience, I believe I can use such skills to create a game development studio!
